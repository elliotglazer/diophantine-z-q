# Local cancellation for square-root-two duplication

This standalone helper formalizes an existing arithmetic calculation. Its public
endpoint is
`ZInQ.ModelDuplicationCancellation.primitive_duplication_local` in
[SqrtTwoDuplicationCancellation.lean](../../ZInQKernel/Contrib/SqrtTwoDuplicationCancellation.lean).
For arbitrary `a b : Zsqrtd 2` with `Ideal.span {a, b} = ⊤`, put
`root = √2`, `delta = 3 - root`,
`F = (a^2 + delta^2*b^2)^2`, `G = 4*a*b*(a^2 - delta^2*b^2)` and
`I = Ideal.span {F, G}`. The theorem proves all three statements:

- `¬ I ≤ (Ideal.span {root})^7`;
- `¬ I ≤ (Ideal.span {delta})^5`;
- every prime ideal containing `I` equals `(root)` or `(delta)`.

There are no nonzero-coordinate or nonzero-form assumptions. This is an ideal
statement in an explicit integral order. Identifying that order with a number
field's integers, choosing primitive projective representatives, interpreting
ideal powers as valuations, estimating ideal norms and deriving the height
inequality remain separate obligations. No elliptic-curve, generator, height or
Z-in-Q theorem is claimed. The external-open-problem KPI increment is zero.

## Provenance and application scope

The proof was ported from
`D5/S3/Factorization/QuadraticIdeals/SqrtTwoDuplicationCancellation.lean`, source
commit `c3cac72be938ba25b9045b306f34f5b71a5e55b0`, SHA-256
`7d661808e5203ef2637d6034a70c4b3f098233dcc7d54853151b763eebd7a877`.
Only module/public syntax, namespace, notices and diagnostic placement changed;
the mathematical definitions, theorem telescope and proof bodies are unchanged.
Codex performed this packaging and CLI validation; it supplies no independent
acceptance of its own port. Earlier supplied review claims are not adopted as
review of this revision.

The existing mathematical source is
[`prop:generator`, lines 370–386](https://github.com/elliotglazer/diophantine-z-q/blob/9c0b3aba60d90fdcac82115f0582a6f52f1054f7/manuscripts/quartic_v13.tex#L370).
That manuscript's SHA-256 is
`9db71bbfcefb37db56eabcf40a5f9dd85de9ed58294635da3dbf6d4f5caa8fcd`.
The local cancellation assertion feeds the lower duplication-height inequality
with `log 392`. The port implements an explicit-order part of that assertion;
it does not supply the bridges to the manuscript's number-field height or alter
the manuscript. No historical objection is classified or closed here, and no
global priority or historical completeness claim is made.

The endpoint depends on the private dyadic numerator bound, norm-seven
numerator bound, prime-support lemma and the two maximal-ideal lemmas in the
same file. Its five Mathlib imports are listed there, at revision
`56a005855ea17e0b0958f73ec801ae140b0a1679`; all nine package pins are in the
unchanged [manifest](../lake-manifest.json). Important applications include
`Zsqrtd.lift` and `norm_eq_one_iff` in `Mathlib/NumberTheory/Zsqrtd/Basic.lean`,
`RingHom.ker_isPrime` and `ker_isMaximal_of_surjective` in
`Mathlib/RingTheory/Ideal/Maps.lean`, and `Ideal.mem_span_pair`,
`span_singleton_pow` and `span_singleton_prime` in the imported ideal API.
These formal dependencies are used through their checked statements; there is
no admitted arithmetic premise or new appeal to an unpublished external theorem.

The application comparison for this partial endpoint is as follows. Independent
review of both this inventory and these comparisons remains pending.

| Obligation | Required and constructed inputs; derivation and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Source hypotheses | The primitive-pair hypothesis is exactly `Ideal.span {a,b} = ⊤`. The endpoint derives `IsCoprime a b` with `Ideal.mem_span_pair`; no assumption is added. |
| Constructed objects | `Order`, `root`, `delta`, `numerator`, `denominator` and `commonIdeal` are explicit definitions in the supplying file, over `Zsqrtd 2`. |
| Domain and index coverage | Both coordinates range over the entire order, and the support conclusion quantifies over every prime ideal containing the common ideal. No family or index restriction is introduced. |
| Transition and comparison maps | Private ring maps to `ZMod 2` and `ZMod 7` send `root` to `0` and `3`, respectively. Their kernel equalities and surjectivity are proved in `root_maximal` and `delta_maximal`; no number-field comparison map is asserted. |
| Consumed-object identity | Membership of the actual numerator and denominator in their span is used in `primitive_duplication_local`. `Ideal.span_singleton_pow` converts containment to divisibility by the same `root^7` and `delta^5`. |
| Coefficients and normalization | All coefficients are integral, in the basis `1, root` of the explicit order. No valuation or height normalization is used; translating to the manuscript's conventions remains open. |
| Local conditions | `dyadic_numerator` excludes divisibility by `root^7`; `delta_numerator` excludes `delta^5`, using the checked finite fact that a sum of two squares vanishes in `ZMod 7` only when both vanish. `prime_support` and maximality exclude all other prime ideals. |
| Exceptional cases | The proof makes no division by a coordinate or form. Zero coordinates and zero denominator are included whenever the primitive hypothesis holds; the nonprimitive pair `(0,0)` is not an input. |
| Downstream consumption | The separate generic importer below consumes the whole exact endpoint. There is no current Lean height consumer. The manuscript's `log 392` step needs the additional bridges stated above. |

## Reproduction and coverage

Lean is pinned to `leanprover/lean4:v4.35.0`. Following the dependency-cache and
fresh-output compiler procedure in [the Lean guide](../README.md), acquire the
five imports with `lake exe cache get` and compile this module directly. The
fixed `ZInQ` library does not include `Examples`; `lake build` or the existing
48-module check alone does not validate this contribution. For example, from
`lean/`, with pinned dependencies already materialized:

```sh
mkdir -p .checks
duplication_output=$(mktemp -d "$PWD/.checks/duplication.XXXXXX")
mkdir -p "$duplication_output/lib/Examples"
duplication_dependencies=$(python3 - <<'PY'
import json, os
from pathlib import Path
p = Path.cwd()
print(os.pathsep.join(str(p / '.lake/packages' / r['name'] / '.lake/build/lib/lean')
      for r in json.loads((p / 'lake-manifest.json').read_text())['packages']))
PY
)
export LEAN_PATH="$duplication_output/lib:$duplication_dependencies"
lean -j1 -Ddebug.skipKernelTC=false \
  -o "$duplication_output/lib/Examples/SqrtTwoDuplicationCancellation.olean" \
  Examples/SqrtTwoDuplicationCancellation.lean
lean -j1 -Ddebug.skipKernelTC=false Checks/SqrtTwoDuplicationCancellationAxioms.lean
```

Check ordinary exported use by saving this as `Import.lean` in that output
directory and running `lean -j1 -Ddebug.skipKernelTC=false "$duplication_output/Import.lean"`
in the same environment:

```lean
module
import Examples.SqrtTwoDuplicationCancellation
open ZInQ.ModelDuplicationCancellation
example (a b : Zsqrtd 2) (hab : Ideal.span {a, b} = ⊤) :
    ¬ commonIdeal a b ≤ (Ideal.span {root}) ^ 7 ∧
    ¬ commonIdeal a b ≤ (Ideal.span {delta}) ^ 5 ∧
    ∀ q : Ideal (Zsqrtd 2), q.IsPrime → commonIdeal a b ≤ q →
      q = Ideal.span {root} ∨ q = Ideal.span {delta} :=
  primitive_duplication_local a b hab
```

The port, this generic ordinary importer and the separate axiom audit each
compiled with exit 0 on November 9, 2026, using fresh project output and a
private pinned dependency cache. The endpoint's reported axioms are exactly
`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`; the audit rejects any others.
The port's SHA-256 is
`72a7273597722a492ab3c6fdb0c8e15f99a0c32117749548e87dc407b123fbad`;
the audit file's is
`febdf4f94007977d03a2ac4dd99817d3386d4d9d9eed7834ff4616e54b219d5b`.
The unmodified source check passed for all 48 accepted modules.
From the repository root,
`python -B scripts/check_audit_history.py --self-test` also passed (7 historical
and 19 application negative controls). These are scoped execution and structural
results. Dependencies came from published caches, not an independent rebuild.
The unchanged proof emits tactic-style and `push_neg` deprecation warnings.

This is non-release contribution preparation. Manuscript/PDF synchronization,
construction replays, cumulative release handoff, release manifests and mirror
publication do not apply: none of those artifacts or claims changes. The frozen
snapshot and its root, manifest, checkers, pins and CI configuration are intact.
The supplied source/interface qualification identified packaging and separate
validation requirements; those are addressed by this layout and these checks.
Non-author mathematical review, findings/inventory assessment and exact-final-
revision protocol closure remain pending with the caller. No PR, push, merge,
upstream acceptance or completed research-release review is claimed.
