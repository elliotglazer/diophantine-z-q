# Archive batch 3: workspace-alias resolution

This index corrects the dependency accounting for PR102. The initial batch description counted repository paths and relative paths but missed original workspace aliases retained in historical manifests. Those references exist; the claim that only the Version17 source-tree manifest referred to the removed files was too strong.

All targets below are preserved at `review-archive-v17`, commit `005b17abfbefd8bee7b34f3bbe8f5aabf872eb1f`. The canonical resolution of each target is `https://github.com/elliotglazer/diophantine-z-q/blob/005b17abfbefd8bee7b34f3bbe8f5aabf872eb1f/` followed by its repository path below. Its recorded SHA256 was checked against the original file. Historical manifests, verdicts and hashes are unchanged.

For a listed target under `research/version14/evidence/release-completion-019/`, the original alias `work/source-risk-review-20261107/` followed by the same suffix resolves to that archived target. This is a rule for the listed targets only, not a claim that every file in the old external workspace was committed. Other observed aliases are listed separately below. Repository-path references likewise resolve at the archive commit rather than requiring a local file in today's checkout.

The retained-reference list was obtained by searching the tracked archive files for these 34 target hashes and their known original workspace aliases, then inspecting the matching JSON path/hash records. It supplements the earlier repository-path scan. It is a targeted check, not a claim to discover arbitrary dynamically constructed paths. None of the target files was read by the traced current computation checks or the additional audit-history self-test. Required checks still run on the deletion revision; that is separate from the historical reference accounting.

Historical packet, installation and report-replay commands that need these payloads must use the complete archive checkout. Their invocation against the incomplete current checkout is retired for these records. For example, use `git worktree add --detach ../diophantine-review-archive 005b17abfbefd8bee7b34f3bbe8f5aabf872eb1f` and follow the original tool instructions there. Old external workspace requirements may remain. No current computation check, kernel check or manuscript build is retired, and no script or released manuscript is changed.
