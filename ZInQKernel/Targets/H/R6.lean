# H target R6: Raynaud's criterion, Galois form

Draft engineering statement extraction (not a proof, not an acceptance). Proposed target
`ZInQ.Targets.H.R6` (closed `Prop`, no universe parameters). Its proof provider is pre-assigned as
`ZInQ.Contrib.H.R6_holds` in module `ZInQKernel.Contrib.H.R6`; **that provider is not declared
anywhere in this change** (no `axiom`, no `sorry`, no placeholder). Registration in
`KERNEL_CONTRACT.json` is only *proposed* (`docs/h-targets/registration-proposal.json`) and needs
maintainer statement review.

Source: the reference `scratch/h-decomposition/Leaves.lean` (fork `diophantine-z-q`, base
`48b5f075e5509678c84685f0d1ec53febd10b1e5`, SHA-256
`99c4fa0535874e6fc737dafe52b82687bc29bc3d592d4bc38a02065f489a05d3`, unchanged):
`PkgI2.RaynaudCriterion` (reference lines 962-977). Statement bodies are copied verbatim except for
the edits listed on each part.

Leaf entry of the reference note `docs/research/h-decomposition.md` (611 lines, SHA-256
`5f46224b5c53fc660bc477b51c79b7ec6ebaafe8cf16124fc3692346d850101e`), §2 (theorem numbers UNVERIFIED
unless marked there):

Note lines 272-277:

**R6. Raynaud's criterion, Galois form.** `K` with a DVR `O`, `A/K` abelian, `m ≥ 3` invertible
in `O`, `A[m]` rational over `K` ⇒ every inertia element satisfies `(σ−1)² = 0` on `A(K̄)[ℓⁿ]`
for every prime `ℓ` invertible in `O`. Ref: SGA 7 I, Exp. IX, Prop. 4.7 with Prop. 3.5;
Silverberg–Zarhin, Ann. Inst. Fourier 45 (1995), Thm 3.5 (read by a model). C (the Galois
consequence). Lean: **yes**, `PkgI2.RaynaudCriterion`. Formalized: none. Steps D2 (and A6 on the
Raynaud route).

Conventions and caveats:
* Consequence (C): the Galois consequence of SGA 7 IX Prop. 4.7 with Prop. 3.5, not the
  semistable-reduction statement itself (note §6 R2).
* universe specialization: the reference statement quantifies over `Type u`; the proposed target
  fixes `u = 0` (`Type`), the instance H uses (the reference bundles it as `.{0}`).
* The objects (abelian varieties, Tate modules, Galois cohomology, ramification groups, …) are the
  PR36 baseline's (`ZInQKernel/HDecomp`), which are textually identical to the reference's apart
  from docstring line breaks; each part is checked against the baseline's own leaf definition by
  `Iff.rfl` (`…_iff_baseline`).
* A placeholder-free statement over genuine definitions is still only as faithful as those
  definitions; locators are UNVERIFIED unless the note marks them VERIFIED (note §6 R1).

**Leaf I2-Ray (Raynaud's criterion, Galois form).** Consequence of SGA 7 I, Exp. IX,
Prop. 4.7 (Raynaud: if `m ≥ 3` is invertible in `O` and the points of `A[m]` are rational over
`K`, then `A` has semistable reduction; also Silverberg–Zarhin, Ann. Inst. Fourier 45 (1995),
Thm 3.5 per h-trust, ASTRA-READ there) and the direction "semistable ⇒ unipotent of echelon ≤ 2"
of SGA 7 IX Prop. 3.5 (numbers UNVERIFIED): every `σ` in the inertia group of `w` satisfies
`(σ - 1)² = 0` on `A(K̄)[ℓⁿ]` for every prime `ℓ` invertible in `O` and every `n`.
