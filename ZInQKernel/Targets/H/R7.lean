# H target R7: Serre–Tate: Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich and potential good reduction

Draft engineering statement extraction (not a proof, not an acceptance). Proposed target
`ZInQ.Targets.H.R7` (closed `Prop`, no universe parameters). Its proof provider is pre-assigned as
`ZInQ.Contrib.H.R7_holds` in module `ZInQKernel.Contrib.H.R7`; **that provider is not declared
anywhere in this change** (no `axiom`, no `sorry`, no placeholder). Registration in
`KERNEL_CONTRACT.json` is only *proposed* (`docs/h-targets/registration-proposal.json`) and needs
maintainer statement review.

Note lines 279-283:

**R7. Serre–Tate.** (a) Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich: good reduction ⟺ inertia fixes `A(K̄)[m]` for all
`m` invertible in `O` ⟺ for infinitely many such `m`. (b) Potential good reduction ⟺ an open
subgroup of inertia fixes all `A(K̄)[ℓⁿ]`. Ref: Ann. of Math. 88 (1968), Thms 1, 2. E (finite-level
forms, equivalent to the Tate-module forms). Lean: **yes**, `PkgI2.NeronOggShafarevich`,
`PkgI2.SerreTatePotentialGood`. Formalized: elliptic curves only (Tau Ceti). Steps A6, A8, C6.

Conventions and caveats:
* Two parts (a), (b), proposed as one target `R7 = R7a ∧ R7b`; finite-level forms, equivalent to the
  Tate-module forms (note §2.1 R7, §6 R2).
* universe specialization: the reference statement quantifies over `Type u`; the proposed target
  fixes `u = 0` (`Type`), the instance H uses (the reference bundles it as `.{0}`).
* The objects (abelian varieties, Tate modules, Galois cohomology, ramification groups, …) are the
  PR36 baseline's (`ZInQKernel/HDecomp`), which are textually identical to the reference's apart
  from docstring line breaks; each part is checked against the baseline's own leaf definition by
  `Iff.rfl` (`…_iff_baseline`).
* A placeholder-free statement over genuine definitions is still only as faithful as those
  definitions; locators are UNVERIFIED unless the note marks them VERIFIED (note §6 R1).

/-- **Part R7(a).**

**Leaf I2-NOS (Serre–Tate 1968, Thm 1; criterion of Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich).**
`K` a field with a discrete valuation ring `O`, `w` a valuation ring of `K̄` over `O`, `A/K` an
abelian variety. Then (a) ⟺ (b) ⟺ (c), where (a) good reduction at `O`, (b) for every `m ≥ 1`
invertible in `O`, inertia at `w` fixes `A(K̄)[m]`, (c) the same for infinitely many such `m`.

/-- **Part R7(b).**

**Leaf I2-ST2 (Serre–Tate 1968, Thm 2; potential good reduction).** For a prime `ℓ`
invertible in `O`: `A` acquires good reduction over a finite extension `K' ⊆ K̄` (at `w ∩ K'`) iff
an open subgroup `I ∩ G_{K'}` of inertia acts trivially on every `A(K̄)[ℓⁿ]`, i.e. the image of
inertia in `Aut(T_ℓ A)` is finite. Used only on the h-b1 route for A6 (not on the route of §5 of
docs/research/pkg-I2.md).
