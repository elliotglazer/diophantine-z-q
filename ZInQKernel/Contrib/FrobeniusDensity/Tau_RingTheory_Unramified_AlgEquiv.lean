# Unramifiedness at a prime transports along an isomorphism of algebras

`Algebra.IsUnramifiedAt R q` says that the localization of the ambient algebra at `q` is formally
unramified over `R`. An isomorphism `ψ : A ≃ₐ[R] B` of `R`-algebras matches the prime complement
of `q` with that of `q.comap ψ`, so it induces an isomorphism of the two localizations over `R`
and carries unramifiedness from `q` to `q.comap ψ`.

## Main results

* `AlgEquiv.isUnramifiedAt_of_eq_comap`: if `B` is unramified at `q` over `R`, then `A` is
  unramified at any prime equal to `q.comap ψ`.

/-- **Unramifiedness transports along an isomorphism of `R`-algebras.** If `B` is unramified over
`R` at a prime `q`, then `A` is unramified over `R` at the corresponding prime `q.comap ψ`, stated
for any prime `p` of `A` equal to it. -/
